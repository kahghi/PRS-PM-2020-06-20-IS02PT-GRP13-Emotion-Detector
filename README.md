## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Our lives were all impacted to different extents in 2020 due to the pandemic, COVID-19. Individually, we were hit by disruptions to our daily lives due to quarantine and social distancing measures, as well as a sense of uncertainty as to when this pandemic would pass. Locally, non-essential and non-healthcare sectors such as the tourism sector was badly hit, where many were laid off. Unemployment rose and the economy contracted. Globally, many countries are still struggling to contain the spread of the pandemic, with restrictions on non-essential business travel, further contributing to the sense of uncertainty and economy contraction.

Despite this, COVID-19 accelerated digital transformation, allowing us to stay connected with our loved ones. The local government has also used digital tools for contact tracing and informing us on our potential exposure to COVID-19 infected patients. Many companies have also turned to digital solutions such as online interviews in view of the strict social distancing measures. This gives us new opportunities such as access to a global pool of talent as well as more flexible interview arrangements. Consequently, there are thus more candidates to filter and evaluate.

In this project, our group has proposed a solution, named Emotion Detector. Emotion Detector is able to automate part of the hiring process (video interview) while providing a platform for candidates to practise their video interview skills. We will also discuss limitations of the solution and suggest possible improvements for future work.
